      I had a patient come into the pharmacy with a prescription that had a list
      of items on it. After spending some time processing the prescription and
      getting the medication ready for the patient, they tell me that they do
      not have the money to pay for the medication. Although setting up accounts
      for patients to pay into at their own pace was not something we usually
      did, I felt like they could not go without their medication as they had
      recently been discharged from the hospital and they needed their
      medications especially the new ones. So, I made the decision to talk to my
      manager and see if we could set up an account so that the patient could
      take their time paying for the medications. I knew that their health was
      paramount and that if we told them that they had to pay or else they would
      not be able to get the medication, that they would probably just prefer to
      go without them. This way their health would deteriorate and the cycle
      would continue. Reflecting on the decision now, I do not regret it and I
      still feel proud of myself for trying my best to better that patient’s
      health outcomes.

      I am from a very close-knit family and throughout my childhood, we had
      always been told to work hard, to be kind and to contribute to society in
      any way we could. Seeing my older siblings and older cousins practise
      these values when I was younger influenced my decision to pharmacy, and
      then now to delve into some software development. I look up to them and
      feel inspired by what they achieve to work hard myself and succeed in
      whatever it is that I need to do.

      My strengths are that having been through quite a lot of challenging
      instances in my work and personal life, I have a higher level of maturity
      which I think enables me to compartmentalise my work and study life. Even
      when I get frustrated, I do not feel like I want to give up so easily but
      instead take a break and try again.

    <p>
      I have only ever studied health sciences and nothing else so in a way, my
      learning has been quite ‘narrow’ and I am a little bit worried that my
      mind would not be able to adapt to the ever-changing curriculum that we go
      through each sprint.

      Back at university, we would often have group projects that we had to work
      together on and it was always challenging to get the ball rolling whenever
      everyone in the group had a different personality or a different way of
      doing things. One strategy I did was to just take charge of the meeting
      and write everyone’s ideas down on a whiteboard so we could all talk about
      the best way to go about our project and to listen to what each other had
      to say. This seemed to be helpful as visually we could all see what our
      ideas were and also it made everyone feel like they were being heard and
      their ideas were important. Now, I would likely do the same but I would
      also maybe find a few examples of things that had been done before on a
      certain topic just so we had some examples to go through to get us
      started.
