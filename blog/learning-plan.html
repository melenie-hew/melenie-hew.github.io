    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <p><u> What is your long term goal or career pathway? </u></p>
    <p>
      My long term goal is to work full time as a software developer and to
      incorporate my passion for healthcare in some way. I want to try and
      create a website that would help people be more informed about their
      health.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </u>
    </p>
    <p>
      My strengths are that I am able to break down the tasks into smaller
      chunks so that I am not just going through the challenges for the sake of
      finishing the sprint but that I am learning along the way too.
    </p>
    <p>
      My limitations are definitely managing my time. I feel like I am
      constantly just trying to keep up and feeling like I’m always behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      <u>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </u>
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like to be able to train myself to work on my weaknesses such as
      tie management and be able to learn alongside my cohort instead of
      catching up from behind them instead. This way, I can truly be a team
      player and also stay on top of the curriculum.
    </p>

    <p>
      <u>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you
      </u>
    </p>
    <p>
      How I will manage myself to work productively and safely with others is,
      at the moment, I have 3 days in a week (2 of those days being a weekday)
      that I do not work and I intend to do the majority of my study during
      those days as it gives me a good opportunity to message the help desk
      channel during the day if I get stuck with anything. As for the other
      days, I plan to spend at least 2-3 hours of my time studying after I
      finish work.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      If things are starting to build up, then I would have to message either
      Shrena or John and let them know as early as possible that I may need more
      time to finish the sprint.
    </p>

    <p>
      <u>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </u>
    </p>
    <p>
      The help desk channel is a really good source of information. I can always
      either look up if a question to my problem has been asked before and see
      if the solution posted helps me, or ask a question myself in the channel.
      I will be able to do these on the days that I do not work or during my
      breaks on a working day.
    </p>

    <p><u> A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team </u></p>
    <p>
      I hope the facilitators are able to take into account that not every
      student will be able to learn at the same pace and be able to extend some
      help when the study feels like it's piling up. But so far the facilitation
      has been great.
    </p>

    <p>
      <u>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </u>
    </p>
    <p>
      I work a full day (9am-5:30pm) on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.
      These are the days that I find it tricky to do any work within the working
      hours. But I do try to work on some tasks during my lunch break. I do also
      go to church Sunday mornings. The rest of the week, I plan to devote most
      of my time to studying.
