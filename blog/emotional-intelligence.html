    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <p><u> What is Emotional Intelligence? </u></p>
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence is the ability to be aware of your actions and
      feelings and how they affect you as well as those around you. It also
      involves being in tune with how others are feeling and responding
      appropriately. Those with high emotional intelligence have better
      relationships and are better able to adapt to change and approach
      challenges. There are 5 building blocks of emotional intelligence:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Self-awareness - knowing how to understand your emotions and how their
        actions impact others
      </li>
      <li>
        Self-regulation - the ability to monitor and master our own behaviour,
        emotions or thoughts and altering them depending on the situation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Motivation - the willingness to defer immediate results for long-term
        success
      </li>
      <li>
        Empathy - Being aware of how others feel and being able to place
        yourself in their shoes to feel how they are feeling
      </li>
      <li>
        Social skills - The ability to build trust and rapport with those around
        you, particularly those you are working with in a team
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><u> How is EQ different to IQ? </u></p>
    <p>
      While EQ refers to your ability to understand and manage your emotions and
      those of others, IQ refers to your capacity to problem-solve, think
      critically and provide logical reasoning. Another way they differ is that
      with EQ, you are able to empathise with others and control your reactions
      to certain situations, leading to healthy and rewarding relationships. A
      good IQ however, makes you a competent and efficient worker with a robust
      skill set.
    </p>
    <p><u> Why is EQ important? </u></p>
    <p>
      The self-awareness from having a high EQ helps you to understand your own
      behaviours or patterns, and how they affect those around you.
      Self-regulation would aid with mastering those emotions, allowing
      ourselves to approach challenges or tasks with an open mind. Motivation,
      empathy and social skills are all important skills when working in a team
      and more importantly to lead a team. You need to be able to motivate not
      just yourself but those around you but also be able to actively listen and
      empathise with how each member in the team is feeling.
