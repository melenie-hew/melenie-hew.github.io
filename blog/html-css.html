      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>
        Content refers to the content of the box, where text and images appear.
        It is what we want to build padding, border or margin around.
      </p>

      <h2>Padding</h2>
      <p>
        Padding is in essence the space around our content and it is
        transparent. It also clears an area around the content
      </p>

      <h2>Border</h2>
      <p>
        Border is the actual border that goes around our content and our
        padding. It can have different colours and widths
      </p>

      <h2>Margin</h2>
      <p>
        Margin is outside the border and is also transparent. It provides space
        between our content and anything around it.
      </p>
    
      <p>The example below shows that my content is 'doggos' and I have set my padding to 50px,
        and my border to a solid one with 15px and green. My margin is 20px
      </p>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>By tagging the 'Doggos' word with a 'div' tag, I was then able to use
        CSS to adjust the padding, border and the margin of the content.
      </p>
      <div>Doggos</div>
